# Dead by Daylight - SSL Bypass

SSL Bypass is a bypass that allows you to pass a "certificate root verification" while using certain programs that are using anything connected to Fiddler or Fiddler itself

## Installation

Installation is pretty simple - All it requires you to do is install these files and put it into directory:

```bash
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dead by Daylight
```
* (Keep in mind the directory may change depending on where you downloaded Dead by Daylight, this is the most common one)

After you have done this process, run **bypass.exe** and put in the directory it is located in (DON'T PRESS ENTER YET). Afterwards, you can run any Fiddler application such as "Kirsty, R-Unlocker, Fiddler, Cookie-Grabbers". You can launch Dead by Daylight and wait until you are in "Press Space" menu but don't press Space yet. After you are in that menu, you can press enter in **bypass.exe** application and wait until it injects. Press OKAY and you can proceed to the game and enjoy!

**Important note**: After you finish playing Dead by Daylight, you have to delete **pakchunk3-WindowsNoEditor.payload** and do this process **AGAIN**! Any bug reports or issues related to this will be ignored!

A throughout tutorial is/will be on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/QEMB67wXzx)** and a YouTube tutorial will arrive soon!

## Issues
Please, make a ticket in [Issues](https://github.com/icedteafrog/ssl-bypass/issues) if you find one. For bug reports, you should generally use **[Discord](https://discord.gg/QEMB67wXzx)** because you may be ignored/ticket may be deleted here.

## Common issues
If you find yourself in position where your SSL file is being detected by EAC or you have an error with EAC cannot be instinated:
* Close Dead by Daylight
* Go to your Dead by Daylight directory where you have "Paks" file
* Delete **pakchunk3-WindowsNoEditor.payload** and do the process from [Installation](#installation)

`If this doesn't work, verify your files and do the process from Installation again. If you find yourself in a situation where neither of these things works, keep trying. When you are devastated from trying, contact us on Discord or make an Issue ticket`

*More issues will be added upon reporting/experience*
